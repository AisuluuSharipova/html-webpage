        <p>
            My name is Aisuluu, and I come from Osh, Alay. I graduated from School 27 Joro Alimov. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Ala-Too International University. I am 19 years old, soon to be 20. I am the second child in my family. In my leisure time, I enjoy horse riding, a skill I have developed over the years. Perhaps my upbringing surrounded by mountains has contributed to my deep appreciation for nature.
